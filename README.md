# Carbon-sources-shape-bacterial-relations
This repository contains the analysis materials used in the preparation of the preprint "Carbon source diversity shapes bacterial interspecies interactions" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.30.646244).
The code is organized into two folders: Python and R.

The Python code file is "Predict_Number_Of_Metabolites_20250812.ipynb".
To run this code, you need to download the files "M9_singles.tsv", "data_figs1.csv", and the files within the "GEM_with_gapfilling_M9media" folder.

The R code file is carbon_sources_shape_bacterial_relations_20250812.Rmd.
To run this code, you need to download the files "experimental_design.xlsx", "phylogenetic_distance.csv", "essmtb_count_table.csv", and the raw data deposited in Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/15074219).

Currently, access to the raw data is restricted.
